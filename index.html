    <p>To My Dearest Ashley 💕</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      There are moments in life that shine brighter than the rest — and knowing you is one of them.
      You’ve always carried yourself with such grace, warmth, and authenticity that it’s impossible not to be drawn to your light.
    </p>
    <br><br>
     <p>
     From our adventures to our heart-to-heart talks, you’ve always been my pillar.
On this special day, I wish you all the happiness, love, and success you deserve🌸.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      You are elegance in motion, kindness in form, and laughter in sound. 
      Every memory with you is a page worth keeping, and every word we’ve shared is written in gold.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      On your 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday, I wish you all the little joys that make life grand — quiet mornings, gentle sunsets,
      success that feels earned, and love that feels like home.
    </p>
    <br>
   <p class="signature">With all my love,<br><em>— Your Forever Friend</em></p>

        <h1>Who’s that<br>girl?</h1>
        <p>
          Ashley is one of the kindest, most genuine and radiant people you’ll ever meet. 
          Her smile lights up any room she walks into, and her laugh is simply contagious. 
          She is very ambitious and when she wants something she will get it.
          Her heart is as beautiful as her spirit she brings warmth, joy, and light 
          wherever she goes.  
          Her friends adore her and everyone who meets her can’t help
           but feel inspired.
          She is so caring to her friends and always there for someone and this 
          is something 
          i really admire.
